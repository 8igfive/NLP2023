The only difference is that the second sentence specifies that the guitar being played is acoustic, which provides slightly more detail. However, this difference is not significant enough to cause a major shift in meaning. Therefore, the semantic similarity score is high, but not quite a 5 out of 5."

The only difference is that the first sentence uses the word \"people\" while the second sentence specifies that there are two men. This slight difference is not significant enough to make the meaning of the sentences fundamentally different. Therefore, the similarity score is 4.5 out of 5."

These differences contribute to a moderate level of semantic similarity, with a score of 3."

However, there are some slight differences in the details, such as the specific numbers quoted and the mention of late European trading in the second sentence. Overall, these differences are relatively minor and do not significantly impact the meaning of the sentences. Therefore, I evaluate their semantic similarity as 4 out of 5."
