While there is daylight for part of the year due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, there are periods of several months where the sun never rises above the horizon. This is due to the extreme latitudes of the poles and the tilt of the Earth's axis. Therefore, Candidate Answers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are all false. However, Candidate Answer 0 is partially true in that there is always some place on Earth where the sun is shining, but it is not true that there is no place on Earth where the sun never shines."
